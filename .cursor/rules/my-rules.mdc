# Core Problem-Solving Principles

### Approach
- **Start with the simplest solution** - Complex approaches are usually wrong approaches
- **Question your assumptions** - Are you solving the actual problem or your interpretation of it?
- **Control the data, not the UI** - Filtering what's shown is simpler than manipulating how it's shown

### Implementation
- **Check the user's query, follow instructions carefully** - Do not do things that you are not asked for
- **Prefer fewer moving parts** - Each state, ref, and effect multiplies complexity
- **When stuck, restart completely** - Don't tweak a fundamentally flawed approach
- **Solve directly, not tangentially** - Attack the core need, not the symptoms

### Response to Feedback
- **"Simpler" means rethink, not refine** - Consider fundamentally different approaches
- **Listen for redirection in feedback** - Keywords like "simpler" often signal you're on the wrong track
- **Complexity is a warning sign** - If your solution requires special cases, it's probably wrong
