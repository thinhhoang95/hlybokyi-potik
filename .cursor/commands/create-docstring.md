You will help the user create the docstrings for the attached Python script.

At the beginning of the file, add a large docstring that:
1. Explains what the file does essentially.
2. Give detailed examples, including input and output examples.
3. Explain briefly the parameters.

Then, for each method, add a docstring (if missing), or revise the content of the docstring to make sure that it is up-to-date.
